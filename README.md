# Bookmarked - Book Review Website

Bookmarked is a digital library for users to upload and organize their books. Through the website they will be able to create books and then assign them to bookshelves to organize them. The website also has a feature where users can generate a book for the times they cant decide what to read, They will have the oportunity to generate a book from a specific bookcase, author, genere or out of their whole library. 

## UX

For the website I want the design to be simple so that its easy for the user to navigate. I want to keep the background white and use brown tones throughout the website to play on the idea of it being a digital library. Users will also have the oportunity to select a colour for each of the books they create so their bookshelves can be personalized to their style.

### Colour Scheme
    
Throughout the website I want the theme to be a white background with tones of brown for the navigation and buttons to play on the theme of bookshelves. 



### Typography
    
    For the Typography I want to use a font that is lightweight, simple and clean.
