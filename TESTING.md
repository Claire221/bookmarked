## Browser Compatibility

For each of my pages I will check them against the top 3 web browsers - Google chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. I initialy checked that all the elements were loading as they should on all 3 browsers.
Once I confirmed they were working as expected I then went into the devtools and changed the viewport width to check the layout and styles against different device sizes.

## Code Validation
    you must showcase proof with screenshots that you've validated any code files, such as HTML, CSS, JS, Python (where applicable)
## Responsiveness
    you must showcase proof with screenshots that you've tested the finished project on different device sizes, such as mobile, tablet, desktop.
## User Story Testing
    This is simple: copy/paste your User Stories from the README, paste them here, and then simply just take the existing screenshots from "Features" section that align with each User Story, and TADA!
## Unfixed Bugs
    list out any unfinished bugs you might have, where applicable... if none, don't just put "I have no bugs"... put something like: "There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of."
