# Bookmarked - Online Virtual Library Website


Bookmarked is a virtual library where users can keep track of all their books, add notes about what they thought of them and organize them all into bookcases. 

I came up with the idea because I love to read and have bookcase full of books but sometimes it can be hard to keep track of them all, and also remember what I liked and disliked about each one so I wanted to build an app that would alow me to organize them all and also have a way for me to leave notes or reviews on each one. 

Because I love to buy books at a rate that is faster than I can read them sometimes I get overwhelmed and cant decide what book to read next, so I created a feature that would take the decision out of your hands. The book generation will allow the user to generate a book from a certain condition such as from a specific author, genre or bookshelf or just generate a book out of all their created books completely taking the decision making away from them and possibly giving them a book they might not have picked for themselves.

## UX

For the website I want the design to be simple and clean so that its easy for the user to navigate. To do this I will use the same fonts and colour scheme throughout the website. 

 
### User Stories
 
-	As a user I want to be able to easily add books to my page
-	As a user I want to be able to easily edit my books
-	As a user I want to be able to create new bookcases to organize my books
-	As a user I want to be able to leave comments or notes about books
-	As a user I want to be able to easily generate a random book to read


### Colour Scheme
    
Throughout the website I want the theme to be a white background with tones of brown for the navigation and buttons to play on the theme of bookshelves.

### Typography
    
For the Typography I want to use a font that is lightweight, simple and clean so that its easy to read and understand. 

### Wireframes
     include screenshots of your wireframes (consider the markdown table format)

## Features

    The aim of my website is to allow people to create an online library of books which they can organize in bookcases. The user will also be able to add notes to their books commention on what they liked or didnt like about them. Another feature of my website is there is a section that allows the user to randomly generate a book for the tiems when they cant decide what to read next.

### Login page

    Each user can create an account which will allow them to create their books and bookshelves. By creating an account it ensurs that the only books and bookshelves that are displayed belong to the user that is logged in.

### Crate books

    Users can create books, they can add titles, authors, tags and descriptions.

### Bookshelves

    Users can create bookshelves to manage and organize their books. 

### Book generation

    For the book generation I went with an option of 3 parameters or just a fully random book.

#### Randomize by bookshelf

    I wanted to give the user the change to randomize a book based on a bookshelf of their choosing, for example if the user has a Fantasy bookshelf they might want to randomly select a Fantasy book, or if they have a bookshelf that contains all the books that they havent read they can randomize a book that is stored on this shelf.

#### Randomzie by Author

    I also wanted to give the user the option to randomize a book based on Author so if they have a favourite author they can randomly get one of their books, Or if they have books by a new Author that they havent read any books from before and are unsure where to start they can just let fate randomly select the book for them

#### By Tags

    When creating books the user has an option to add tags, these are used in the search function of the website so I wanted to have the option of randomizing a book by the tags associated with it. 

#### By all books

    Finally I wanted to add an option for when the user really wants a random book, they dont want it from a specific bookshelf or from a specific genre. The randomize by all books option will take all the books that the user has created and randomly give them a book to read.

### Features Left to Implement
